Terraform augument and attributes 

**Argument:**

An argument is like telling someone what to do.
It's something you provide when you're asking for a resource or module.
Example: If you're ordering a pizza, your arguments might be the type of crust, toppings, and size you want.

**Attribute:**

An attribute is like asking someone about themselves or what they've done.
It's something you get back from a resource or module.
Example: If you ordered a pizza, the attributes might include its size, the type of crust, and the toppings.
In Terraform, when you define a resource, you use arguments to specify what you want (e.g., the size and type of a virtual machine), and when Terraform creates that resource, it provides you with attributes (e.g., the IP address of the created virtual machine).
